# DietTracker-Mobile

DietTracker is an application that is used to track a user's daily intake of food and beverages. The original version of the app was developed using an Angular frontend and a Django REST Framework API on the backend.

The mobile version is a Universal Windows Platform application that can be run on a Windows 10 computer or a device running Windows IOT.  The mobile version makes use of the same backend that that is used by the Angular frontend.  The repository for the backend is located here: https://github.com/jfranco1701/DietTracker-backend.

The application contains a local copy of the USDA Food Composition database.  This data is stored in a SQLite database and deployed along with the app.
